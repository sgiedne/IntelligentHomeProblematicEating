                <h2>What we do</h2>
                <p>We're working on building a system that is capable of recognizing patterns of normal and abnormal user behavior with respect to food habits within user’s homes. Our intention is to detect abnormal eating in “real-enough time” such that an intervention can be presented before or right after the behavior takes place. We will detect the user's actions and habits using sensors placed strategically in certain rooms (places of eating) and in food and food-related item storage locations.</p>

                            <ul class="small_font"> <strong>Things to think about</strong> Since the number of overeating patterns can vary between different users, we cannot employ K Means clustering </ul>

                            <ul class="small_font"> <strong>Implementation</strong> We've decided to go with Mean Shift Clustering(MSC) to cluster input data. We have split the data with a window size of 3 hours. These 3 hour samples will be fed into the MSC algorithm. From the resulting clusters, we will target those clusters which have the largest number of overeating episodes within them and run each of these clusters through the Longest Common Subsequence(LCS) algorithm to abstract out patterns of overeating.</ul>
                            <ul class="small_font"> <strong>Things to think about</strong> We must have the machine maintain state and remember the identified patterns of overeating. The system must also be able to provide a suitable form of intervetion to the user to prevent the user from overeating. </ul>
                            <ul class="small_font"><b>Next steps</b> Improve/update our implementation process and continue working on the paper.</ul>
